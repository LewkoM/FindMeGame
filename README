1.Game title:
  "Find me"

2. Production technology:
Java SDK

3. Purpose of the game:
The aim of the game is to learn geometric figures and colors. The game activates the cognitive functions of the brain and supports visual
memorization through newer and newer shapes and combinations. In addition, it teaches patience when the character has to move to the top of the board,
carefully avoiding incorrect pieces. The game is addressed mainly to preschool children, as well as to people with mental retardation and people with a 
history of neurological diseases.

4. Description:
The player's task, using the keyboard, is to find the appropriate geometric figure among many possible combinations located in the areas of the entire board,
which is additionally filled with a specific color. The position, shape and color of the figures will change randomly each time you start a level.
As a result of the correct choice, the player will be promoted to higher levels (self-improvement), while if selected incorrectly, the game levels will be 
reset and the player will start the game from the beginning, i.e. from the first level.
